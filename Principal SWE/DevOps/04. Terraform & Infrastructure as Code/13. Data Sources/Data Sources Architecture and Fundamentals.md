# Data Sources Architecture and Fundamentals

## 1. Definition
**Data Sources Architecture and Fundamentals** represents a core infrastructure paradigm, automation standard, and reliability primitive within **Terraform & Infrastructure as Code**.
Data Sources in Terraform & Infrastructure as Code. Covering Foundational architecture, declarative invariants, and core primitives.
It establishes formal guarantees on platform resilience, immutable deployments, and continuous operational velocity:
- **Declarative & Immutable Invariants:** Enforces Infrastructure-as-Code state convergence, zero-downtime rolling releases, and automated health reconciliation loops.
- **Observability & SLO Budget:** Provides real-time telemetry across the Four Golden Signals (Latency, Traffic, Errors, Saturation) with deterministic automated rollback thresholds.

## 2. Mental Model
```text
Production Cloud Platform & Deployment Pipeline for Data Sources Architecture and Fundamentals:
[ Git Repository / Code Push ] ───> [ Automated CI / Security Gates ]
                                                   │
                   ┌───────────────────────────────┴───────────────────────────────┐
                   ▼                                                               ▼
     [ Container Image Registry / ECR ]                              [ Terraform / IaC State Lock ]
                   │                                                               │
                   └───────────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────┘
                                                   ▼
                     [ Kubernetes Cluster / Cloud Infrastructure (GitOps Sync) ]
```
- **Operational Principle:** Self-healing, declarative infrastructure with automated reconciliation and zero-touch continuous delivery.

## 4. Gotchas
- **State Drift & Out-of-Band Mutations:** Manually modifying cloud console settings without updating Terraform/GitOps repositories causes state drift and accidental overwrites during subsequent CI applies.
- **Cascading Pod Eviction Thundering Herd:** Inadequate resource limits (CPU/Memory) without Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) triggers OOMKilled cascades and node crashloops during traffic spikes.
