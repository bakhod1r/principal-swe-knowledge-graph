# Object Oriented Programming in Python Common Gotchas and Performance Pitfalls

## 1. Definition
**Object Oriented Programming in Python Common Gotchas and Performance Pitfalls** represents a fundamental language feature, operational construct, and engineering standard within **Python**.
Class hierarchies, Method Resolution Order (MRO, C3 linearization), super(), __slots__, and dataclasses. Covering Critical gotchas, runtime edge cases, and performance pitfalls.
It establishes precise runtime invariants, performance characteristics, and type guarantees:
- **Runtime & Semantic Invariants:** Enforces memory safety, deterministic execution semantics, and optimal CPU cache/compiler optimization.
- **Production Idiom:** Follows official idiomatic design principles to maximize clarity, maintainability, and scalability across enterprise systems.

## 2. Mental Model
```text
Execution Flow & Architectural Lifecycle for Object Oriented Programming in Python Common Gotchas and Performance Pitfalls:
[ Developer Code / Source Text ] ───> [ Compiler / AST / Lexical Parser ]
                                                       │
                   ┌───────────────────────────────────┴───────────────────────────────────┐
                   ▼                                                                       ▼
     [ Bytecode / Type Checker / Schema ]                                    [ Runtime Engine / Optimizer ]
                   │                                                                       │
                   └───────────────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────────┘
                                                       ▼
                                     [ Hardware Execution / Safe Evaluation ]
```
- **Engineering Principle:** Clarity of invariants and deterministic lifecycle management over implicit side-effects.

## 3. Usage
```python
# Production Python implementation for Object Oriented Programming in Python Common Gotchas and Performance Pitfalls
from typing import Final, Protocol

class ObjectOrientedProgramminginPythonCommonGotchasandPerformancePitfallsService:
    def __init__(self, name: str) -> None:
        self._name: Final[str] = name
        self._active: bool = True

    def execute(self) -> dict[str, str]:
        if not self._active:
            raise RuntimeError("Service is currently inactive")
        return {"status": "success", "service": self._name}
```

## 4. Gotchas
- **Implicit Mutations & Side Effects:** Unintended in-place modifications of shared mutable state without proper locking or immutability guarantees lead to subtle concurrency bugs.
- **Resource Leaks on Unclosed Handles:** Failing to use proper context managers (`with` / `try-with-resources` / transactions) leaks file descriptors, connection pools, and database locks.
