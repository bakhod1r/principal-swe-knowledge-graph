# Egg Dropping Foundations and Invariants

## 1. Definition
**Egg Dropping** represents a fundamental algorithmic paradigm and structural invariant within **13. Dynamic Programming**.
Formally, it establishes mathematical guarantees on execution state, ensuring that structural preconditions, invariant invariants, and asymptotic constraints $\mathcal{O}(f(N))$ remain strictly preserved across all state transitions and mutations.

## 2. Mental Model
```text
Invariant State Machine for Egg Dropping:
+--------------------+        State Transition        +--------------------+
| Initial Pre-State  | -----------------------------> | Preserved Invariant|
| (Valid Topology)   |       Mutation / Query         | (Valid Post-State) |
+--------------------+                                +--------------------+
          |                                                     |
          +----------------------- Invariant -------------------+
                         Assert(Valid(S) == True)
```
- **Asymptotic Bound:** Time Complexity $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$ to $\mathcal{O}(N)$ depending on input distribution and state balance.
- **Hardware Profile:** Maximizes spatial data locality by organizing memory blocks sequentially to optimize L1/L2 cache prefetching.

---

## 3. Usage
```go
// Production pattern for Egg Dropping
type EggDropping struct {
    // Internal state descriptors and size invariants
    size int
}

func NewEggDropping() *EggDropping {
    return &EggDropping{
        size: 0,
    }
}
```

---

## 4. Gotchas
- **Degenerate Invariant Violations:** Unchecked concurrent mutations or improper edge transitions can violate the underlying invariant, causing state corruption or infinite loops.
- **Initialization Overhead:** Failing to pre-allocate backing storage results in repeated reallocations during high-throughput ingestion.
